## 1. Overview

The backend architecture consists of four specialized microservices built with .NET 9.0 and ASP.NET Core, each designed to handle specific domain responsibilities while maintaining clean separation of concerns. This microservices architecture provides scalability, maintainability, and flexibility for the portfolio management ecosystem.

**Architecture Principles:**
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Each service focuses on a specific business domain
- **Microservices Pattern**: Independent services with clear boundaries and APIs
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through well-defined APIs and events
- **Shared Security Model**: Consistent authentication and authorization across all services
- **Performance Optimization**: Each service implements domain-specific performance strategies

---

## 2. Service Architecture

The backend services follow a layered architecture pattern with clear separation between:
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation with dependency injection
- **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction with Entity Framework Core
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL databases with optimized schemas and indexing

**Communication Patterns:**
- **Synchronous**: HTTP-based API calls for direct service-to-service communication
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven patterns for non-blocking operations
- **Real-time**: SignalR integration for live communication features
